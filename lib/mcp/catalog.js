/**
 * The resource catalog: every server collection the generic `resource_*`
 * tools can reach, as data.
 *
 * Each entry says where the collection lives and which operations the
 * tools may run on it, with the server's operationId for each (the tests
 * check every one against the server's OpenAPI document, and
 * `resource_describe` uses them to find the request schemas). A draft of
 * this table comes from `scripts/catalog-draft.js`; the table itself is
 * reviewed by hand and never discovered at run time, so a collection the
 * server adds (an administration one, say) reaches the model only when
 * someone decides it should.
 *
 * Paths are relative to the parent's item path, or to the account
 * (`/v{N}/users/{account}`) for top-level types; `version` applies to the
 * whole path. Verbs map to requests as follows:
 *
 *   list     GET    <collection>
 *   create   POST   <collection>      (PUT <item> when `upsert`)
 *   get      GET    <item>
 *   update   PUT    <item>
 *   patch    PATCH  <item>            (update with `merge: true`)
 *   delete   DELETE <item>
 *   clone    POST   <item>/clone
 *   projects PUT    <item>/projects   (the `projects` field of an update)
 *
 * A type without `id` is a single resource of its parent (get / update on
 * the path itself).

 * @property {boolean} [listWhole]  The server answers the whole list at once, without

Optional: data.payload_type ("template_payload" with data.payload such as "{{payload}}", "source_payload" to keep the payload as is, "source_event", "none") and data.payload_function (a function of the product code).';

const PROFILE_API_NOTES = `${PROFILE_NOTES} An API resource is a REST endpoint added to every device of the product and dispatched by the server: {enabled, request: {data: {target, payload_type?, payload?, payload_function?, ...}}, response: {data: {payload_type, source?, payload?, payload_function?}}}. request.data.target is one of: "resource" ({resource}: a device resource), "resource_stream" ({resource_stream}; defaults to the API resource name), "product_stream" ({product, product_stream}), "property" ({property}), "function" ({function}: product code), "endpoint_call" ({endpoint}), "plugin_endpoint" ({plugin, path}), "topic" ({topic}), "none". Payload types: "template_payload" (default; data.payload is a template such as "{{payload}}"), "source_payload" (forward the body), "source_event" (the whole event), "none". response.data {payload_type: "none"} is fire-and-forget; "source_payload" returns the target's answer. Example: {"enabled": true, "request": {"data": {"target": "resource_stream", "resource_stream": "backup_complete", "payload_type": "source_payload"}}, "response": {"data": {"payload_type": "none"}}}. Called by device ({tool:device_resource_call} on a device of the product), or for the product as a whole with {tool:product_resource_call}, which needs "device_id_resolver": "<function of the product code>" in the entry to find each payload's device. A resource computed by code (target "function") also needs response {"source": "request_response", "payload_type": "source_payload"} to return the value; this is how Virtual devices get data ({tool:doc_read} id "product-code").`;

const PROFILE_BUCKET_NOTES = `${PROFILE_NOTES} A profile bucket stores, for each device of the product, the samples of a data source; the bucket itself is created on the first sample. Shape: {enabled, name, description, backend: "mongodb" (default) or "influxdb", data: {source, ...}, retention?: {period, unit: "minutes"|"hours"|"days"|"months"|"years"}, tags?: []}. ${LISTENER_SOURCE} Unless the bucket name has "{{device}}", samples get "device" and "group" tags, so one bucket holds the whole fleet. Sampling a resource needs data {"source": "resource", "resource", "update": "interval", "interval", "magnitude", "payload": "{{payload}}"} (or "payload_type": "source_payload"), which stores the value as it comes; the default template payload with no "payload" writes nothing. Deleting the entry stops recording but keeps the bucket and its data. Example: {"enabled": true, "name": "backups", "backend": "mongodb", "data": {"source": "resource_stream", "resource_stream": "backup_complete", "payload_type": "source_payload"}, "retention": {"period": 1, "unit": "years"}}.`;
