# Changelog

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-10

Incompatible change of the MCP tools: from 48 tools, one per type and
operation, to 22, less than half the size in `tools/list` (about 22,000
characters instead of 51,400, roughly 6,100 tokens instead of 14,300).

### Added

- Seven generic tools over a catalog of the server's resource types:
  `resource_describe`, `resource_list`, `resource_get`, `resource_create`,
  `resource_update` (`merge: true` patches property values; `projects` in
  the body sets the resource's projects), `resource_delete`,
  `resource_clone`. The catalog (`mcp/catalog.js`) covers devices,
  products, buckets, dashboards, endpoints, storages, asset types and
  groups, projects, tokens, alarm rules and instances, claims, account
  properties and their children (device properties, tokens, buckets, bucket
  tags, services and HTTP callback; product properties, profile entries,
  code and services; bucket tags and exports; asset type, asset group and
  project properties; roles, project members and roles, syncs) and the
  server's administration (users, hosts, domains, brands, OAuth clients,
  identity providers, proxies, under /v1 rather than an account). Each tool
  offers only the types that support its verb; permissions are the
  server's to enforce.
- `resource_describe` reads the request schemas and examples from the
  server's own OpenAPI document (`/v1/server/swagger.json`), cached per
  server and version in `~/.config/<cli>/cache`; servers that do not publish
  it fall back to the bundled copy (`openapi/swagger.json`, the server's
  develop as of 2026-10-10). It also lists, for each verb, the permission action a token
  needs (`permissions`: `Device` / `ReadDeviceStatus`…), taken from the same
  document.
- Resource hooks: generated device credentials, the identity's product
  template, token expiries as durations ("30d") and permission tree checks.
  CLIs add theirs with `runCli({ resourceHooks })`.
- `resource_call`: actions of a type that are not CRUD, declared in the
  catalog with their operationId (checked against the OpenAPI document):
  verify a domain, restart a host or read/replace its settings, send a
  brand's test email, call an endpoint, export a product, read a device's
  usage, test an alarm rule (rule, source, notification).
- Tools that are not CRUD: `bucket_data_read`, `bucket_data_write`,
  `device_resource_list`, `device_resource_call`, `device_data_send`,
  `device_overview`, `product_resource_call`,
  `storage_file_list` / `_read` / `_write` / `_delete`.
- `dashboard_publish`: publishes HTML apps as url-source dashboards
  (servers with url-source dashboards). Uploads a local folder (a build
  output, subfolders included) or inline files to a public storage, with
  `prune` to delete files a new build no longer has; and/or points
  dashboards at it: dashboards of the collection, or the `dashboard`
  property of a device, product, asset type, asset group or project
  (checked before anything is uploaded), each with its own entry page and
  initial hash route. One storage can serve an app shared by many
  dashboards. Entry urls carry `?v=` against stale caches; scripts and
  styles without a content hash are reported.
- `doc_read`: the documentation the server publishes for agents, listed in
  its index (`/sdk/docs.json`): a guide to the platform's concepts, the
  dashboard SDK reference, its TypeScript declarations… A guide added to the
  index reaches the model without a CLI release. The same documents are MCP
  resources (`<prefix>://<id>`), the concepts guide is appended to
  `resource_describe` without a type, and the SDK reference to
  `resource_describe` of the dashboard type. Only paths on the profile's own
  server are followed. CLIs add the guides they ship with
  `runCli({ docs })`, listed first and readable without a server.
- `scripts/catalog-draft.js`: drafts catalog entries from an OpenAPI
  document.

### Changed

- A 403 no longer says the token may have expired: it says the token or the
  account is not allowed, with the server's reason. The error code is still
  `unauthorized`.
- `profiles` is now `profile_list`; `bucket_read` is `bucket_data_read`;
  `resource_list` / `resource_call` (device resources) are
  `device_resource_list` / `device_resource_call`.
- `buildTools(extraTools, { admin, hooks })`; `genericTools` is now a
  function of the same options.

### Removed

- The per-type tools, replaced by `resource_*` on the matching type:
  `devices`, `device_info`, `device_create`, `device_set_product`,
  `device_delete`, `products`, `product_create`, `product_update`,
  `product_delete`, `product_property_*`, `product_profile_*`,
  `property_get`, `property_set`, `token_*`, `device_token_*`,
  `alarm_rules`, `alarm_rule_*`, `alarm_instances`, `alarm_instance_*`,
  `buckets`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed

- `repository.url` in the canonical `git+https` form npm expects; first release
  published from GitHub Actions through Trusted Publishing.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-10

First version, extracted from the core of `thinr` 1.3.5 and made
independent of the product.

### Added

- CLI identity (`defineIdentity`): name, config folder, environment prefix,
  login token, OAuth client, MCP server name and tool prefix, product
  template.
- `runCli` with the generic commands (login, logout, profile, device, product,
  bucket, mcp) and extension points: `register` with the command groups,
  `onNoCommand`, `mcpTools`, `mcpInstructions`.
- MCP tools declared with bare names and `{tool:x}` / `{family:x}`
  references, expanded and validated when the server starts; CLI tools can
  replace generic ones explicitly (`replaces: true`).
- `device create` / `device_create`, `bucket list` / `buckets`.

### Changed (compared with thinr 1.3.5)

- The API base URL and token come from the profile active for each request,
  and the MCP `profile` argument is scoped per call (AsyncLocalStorage).
- Servers may carry a scheme (`http://localhost:8080`); profiles are named
  after the host.
- `logout` forgets the current profile (or `--all`) and revokes the API token
  the CLI minted, instead of deleting every profile.
- Login works without prompts (`--server --username --token`) and fails with
  a clear message when a prompt has no terminal.
- The config file is written with mode 600.
- Server error messages are kept in the errors shown to the user.
